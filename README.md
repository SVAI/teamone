##GOAL: 
predict/classify the response to a drug based on features of the drug, as well as correlate drug targets with their relevance in gene expression (RNA-seq) and patient genotypes (WGS)

### steps 

1. Parsing drug screen data and drug metadata into vectors for a model

2. Create off-the-shelf machine learning models as well as a simple multi-layer perceptron

3. Interpret the results of the model

4. Correlate the gene targets of drugs with their relevance in RNA-seq and WGS data
