# GoodDocData -- A Template for Simple and Clear Documentation of Hackathon Analyses!

*adapted from [NCBI-Hackathons/GoodDoc](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/GoodDoc) with some tweaks for analysis-driven projects*

*instructions in italics can be deleted as sections are filled in*

*most fields are optional, Conclusion and Important Resources are required*

## Please cite our work -- here is the ICMJE Standard Citation:

### ...and a link to the DOI: *You can make a free DOI with zenodo, synapse, figshare, or other resources <link>*

## Awesome Logo *(if applicable)*

## Website *(if applicable)*

## Abstract *: Summarize everything in a few sentences.* 

## Introduction *: What's the problem? Why should we solve it?*

## Methods *: How did we go about solving it?*

## Results *: What did we observe? Figures are great!*

## Conclusion/Discussion: 

### Please make sure you address ALL of the following:

#### *1. What additional data would you like to have*

#### *2. What are the next rational steps?* 

#### *3. What additional tools or pipelines will be needed for those steps?*

#### *4. What skills would additional collaborators ideally have?*

## Reproduction: *How to reproduce the findings!*

### Docker

*The Docker image contains <R/jupyter> notebooks of all analyses and the dependencies to run them. *Be sure to note if you need any special credentials to access data for these analyses, **don't package restricted data** in your containers!*

Instructions for running the following notebooks: *be sure to adjust these instructions as necessary! check out https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/nf-hackathon-2019 for example containers and instructions*

1. `docker pull <your dockerhub repo>/<this container>` command to pull the image from the DockerHub
2. `docker run <your dockerhub repo>/<this container>` Run the docker image from the master shell script

### Important Resources *: primary data, github repository, Synapse project, dockerfile link etc.*

## Goal: 
Our goal is to classify and predict responses to a drug based on features like X, Y, Z. We then aimed to correlate the drug targets with relevance in gene expression (RNA-seq) and patient genotypes (WGS) @icon-fas-fa-flask

##   What is Neurofibromatosis? 

Neurofibromatosis is a set of three genetic conditions that cause tumors to grow throughout the body. It is automsomal dominant, though about half of all cases occur due to a random mutation.

__NF1__  
* Occurrs in about 1:3000 births  
    * most common genetic predisposition to neurological problems  
* Commonly diagnosed in early childhood or infancy   
* Characteristics (from CTF.org)
    * caf√©-au-lait spots
    * neurofibromas (cutaneous, subcutaneous, plexiform)
    * scoliosis
    * learning disabilities and cognitive differences
    * larger head circumference
    * delayed or early puberty
    * shorter than average
    * optic gliomas
    * bone deformaties
    * cosmetic concerns
    * high blood pressure  
* The affects on an individual can vary wildly, even amongst identical twins! 


__NF2__  
* (info also from ctf.org)
* about 1:25000 worldwide
* characterized by the growth of vestibular schwannomas on the nerve that connects sound and balance information between the ears and bran
* common signs/symptoms
    * tinnitus
    * hearing loss
    * balance issues
    * facial weakness
    * brain and cranial nerve damage
    * swallowing difficulties
    * seizures
    * vision loss
    * balance and mobilitoy loss 


__Schwannomatosis__ (sp?)  
(all from ctf again)
* about 1:40000
* only recently identified
* characterized by the development of schwannomas, usually on spinal and peripheral nerves
    * schwannomas are abnormal growth of Schwann cells which are insulators to nerves (?????)
* common signs
    * numbness, tingling
    * weakness, including favial weakness
    * bowel and urinary dysfunction
    * vision changes
    * headaches

## About the drug study

**this is directly from the page, not in my own words at all**  
To generate this data, we combined compound/drug screens from multiple different projects, representative of about 1.3 million compound-concentration-cell line combinations (some of which are combination experiments, where a mixture of 2 compounds are tested). We then ran these data through a common pipeline to generate summary statistics for each compound-cell line experiment.

## steps 

##### 1. Parsing drug screen data and drug metadata into vectors for a model

##### 2. Create off-the-shelf machine learning models as well as a simple multi-layer perceptron

##### 4. Correlate the gene targets of drugs with their relevance in RNA-seq and WGS data
